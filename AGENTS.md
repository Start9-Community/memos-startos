# AGENTS.md

This is a StartOS service-package repository — it builds a `.s9pk` for StartOS.

Develop it inside a StartOS packaging workspace created by `start-cli s9pk init-workspace`,
which provides the packaging guide and agent context one level up. If you're reading this in a
bare clone with no workspace, the full guide is at <https://docs.start9.com/packaging>.

Work this package's `TODO.md` from top to bottom. Keep `README.md` (architecture, for developers and LLMs) and `instructions.md` (end-user docs) in sync with your changes.

## Inspecting a running install

To run a command inside a service's container (read its generated config, grep app logs), use `start-cli package attach <id> -n <subcontainer-name> -- <cmd>`. Select the subcontainer by **name** with `-n` (the name passed to `SubContainer.of` in `main.ts`, e.g. `-n memos`) or by image with `-i`. Note: `-s/--subcontainer` matches the internal **Guid**, not the name, so passing a name to `-s` fails with "no matching subcontainers". A service with more than one subcontainer requires a selector; with none given, `attach` falls back to an interactive picker that panics in a non-TTY shell — that's the missing selector, not a TTY requirement.

## Package-specific notes

- **SDK is `@start9labs/start-sdk@2.0.9`** (upgraded 2026-08-04; the workspace
  host is now StartOS 0.4.0.1 — see the workspace `AGENTS.local.md`). Service
  interfaces are read via `sdk.host.getOwn(effects, 'ui', h =>
  h?.bindings[uiPort]?.interfaces['ui'] ?? null)` — the 1.x
  `sdk.serviceInterface.*` accessors were removed in SDK 2.0.0.
- **Single daemon** (`memos`, SQLite embedded, no sidecars). `MEMOS_INSTANCE_URL`
  auto-derived from the `ui` host (pinnable via Set Instance URL). Backups are a
  single whole-volume rsync of `main`.
- See `TODO.md` for the remaining verification checklist and `README.md`
  for the architecture and the known runtime nuances (the volume ownership /
  non-root runtime, the `useEntrypoint()` entrypoint script, and the reactive
  `MEMOS_INSTANCE_URL` derivation strategy).
